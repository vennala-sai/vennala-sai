### Hi there üëã
üåü Sai Vennala | Java & Python Developer | Software Engineering Enthusiast

# üí´ About Me:


üíº **My Professional Experience:** I‚Äôm a versatile full-stack software engineer with experience in development and quality assurance across enterprise banking, cloud systems, and AI-powered applications. 

At TD Canada Trust, I streamlined QA automation, improved the accuracy of trade data, and helped ensure compliance with financial regulations. 

At FDM, I contributed to an AI-powered project management assistant for Royal Bank of Canada using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Ollama, LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, and a Python/MySQL backend. I also built a critical insurance microservice for an internal FDM banking project using Java, Spring Boot, React, and AWS RDS.

Previously, at SOTI, I optimized large-scale systems and handled cloud integrations with Solace PubSub+ and Docker. I‚Äôve also mentored young learners as a programming instructor at Code Ninjas, helping them build a strong foundation in coding. With expertise in Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Selenium, manual testing, AI integration, AWS, and Agile methodologies‚ÄîI focus on delivering scalable, high-quality software solutions.
 
üìö **A Graduate from York University** with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science, achieving First Class Standing and Dean‚Äôs Honour Roll. My coursework spanned from Data Structures and Algorithms to Software Design, emphasizing Agile methodologies and Object-Oriented Programming.<br>

üî≠ **I‚Äôm currently working on** a Java-based dating app, leveraging Spring Boot for seamless REST API integration, and diving into AWS for deploying scalable cloud environments. On the side, I'm exploring Python for data analysis and automation tasks.<br>üå± **I‚Äôm currently learning** advanced concepts in cloud computing, containerization with Docker, and microservices architecture to enhance my Java development skills.<br>üëØ **I‚Äôm looking to** collaborate on open-source Java projects, especially those focused on creating impactful solutions in the fields of web applications or cloud services.<br>ü§î **I‚Äôm looking for** help with deepening my knowledge in cloud-native development practices and optimizing Java applications for high scalability and efficiency.<br>ü§ù **Seeking help with** deepening my understanding of cloud-native development, specifically within AWS ecosystems, and how to best utilize these services for optimizing application performance and security.<br>üí¨ **Ask me about** Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, SQL, and transitioning projects from conception to deployment. I'm also happy to share my experience with performance testing and system optimization.<br>‚ö° **Fun Fact:** My project at Questron Technologies, involving a dynamic web application built with Spring Boot, not only streamlined inventory management but also introduced me to the practical challenges and solutions in cloud deployments.
